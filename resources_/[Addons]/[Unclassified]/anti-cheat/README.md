### About TigoAntiCheat

AntiCheat by Tigo is a resource created for FiveM. This resource is to detect hackers and ban them from your server.

### Requirement
- None

### Get Started
In order to use this anticheat, all `esx:`, `esx_` etc. must be renamed.
The anticheat replaces `esx_...` server calls to perm bans.

Change e.g. `esx_drugs` to `tac_drugs` (only `EventHandlers`, `ClientEvents` and `ServerEvents`, leave resource folder just the orignal resource name example: `esx_drugs`).

### Enable `/anticheat` for players
If you want `/anticheat` command available for example your Admin's than you can add this line to your `server.cfg`
```cfg
add_ace group.admin tigoanticheat.commands allow
```
Console is always allowed to execute `/anticheat` command.
Use `/anticheat` or `/anticheat help` to show all available commands.

### Bypass
If you have players like Admin's who should never be banned, you should add the following to their group
```cfg
add_ace group.admin tigoanticheat.bypass allow
```

### Server.cfg
A number of variables must be added in your `server.cfg`

Code | Values | Type 
:---|:---|:---:
`set tigoanticheat.godmode true` | `true` Check and ban players if godmode has been detected | `boolean` 
`set tigoanticheat.updateidentifiers true` | `true` If a player is banned and joined with new identifiers, those identifiers will banned immediately. | `boolean` 
`set tigoanticheat.bypassenabled false` | `true` All players with `tigoanticheat.bypass` will not be checked or banned. | `boolean`

This resource was created by me with all the knowledge at the time of writing. It doesn't mean cheating becomes impossible. Updates will be done if there is time and reason to do so. The request of new functionality is allowed, but does not mean that it will be released.
